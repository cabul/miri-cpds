Comparison between Banket and NoWaitBanket:
- Banket use wait() and notifiAll() functions in synchronization mechanism. It use wait() to put waiting threads into a queue, if the thread can't be executed immediately, it will wait until someone notify it, and be executed sequentially. 
- NoWaitBanket use if-else in synchronization mechanism. Every time the thread is called, it checks the condition in if-else, if the condition is true, then the thread is executed. If not, the thread will quit without doing anything. 

Advantages and disadvantages: 
- Banket makes use of a queue to execute the threads in sequence, it's more correct, but it's more memory expensive.
- NoWaitBanket just have a try each time until it can be executed. It's more light in memory consumption, but it can't execute the threads in sequence, which makes the logic mess.
